## Background

One of the projects I worked for MassDOT/MBTA’s <a href="https://www.mass.gov/transportation-performance" target="_blank">OPMI</a>
 was envisioning a way to encourage university students to ride the T as an accessible and affordable means of transportation. 
**I developed a system of interest-based maps to highlight how students can use the T to reach notable destinations
  in Greater Boston and surrounding areas.** My team and I took an approach that focused on students with
   different levels of experience with the T and the city of Boston—we aimed to present the T as a connector
    to Boston’s different cultural attractions.

## Process

The first demographic of students we talked about targeting were those unfamiliar with the T and Boston in general. However, I thought about how that’s only one small subsection of students, and the information becomes unnecessary after a while. Students have many different levels of experience, and that’s what led me to design for three main categories of university students.

I designed three different “levels” of maps.
With these maps, I wanted to accomplish a set of goals:
- Emphasize lines/stops near universities for students’ convenience
- Highlight notable activities/areas
- Remove the need to work with university-specific guidelines (official colors, fonts, etc.)
- Convey pro-social and pro-environment aspects of taking public transportation (support museums, local events/festivals, restaurants, etc.)
- Maintain the T as a symbolic Boston experience

## Final Product

The maps, personas, and descriptions were packaged into a proposal presented to the MBTA’s web team in hopes of being implemented in the future.
