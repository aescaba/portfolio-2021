### Background

One of the projects I worked for MassDOT/MBTA’s <a href="https://www.mass.gov/transportation-performance" target="_blank">OPMI</a>
 was envisioning a way to encourage university students to ride the T as an accessible and affordable means of transportation. 
**I developed a system of interest-based maps to highlight how students can use the T to reach notable destinations
  in Greater Boston and surrounding areas.** My team and I took an approach that focused on students with
   different levels of experience with the T and the city of Boston—we aimed to present the T as a connector
    to Boston’s different cultural attractions.
