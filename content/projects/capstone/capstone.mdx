## Background

For my final capstone project, I wanted to incorporate two of my passions: food and Filipino culture. A personal project I had already been thinking of making was documenting family recipes, so I thought my capstone project was the perfect way to combine that idea with my interests.

## Process

The idea that I formed throughout the course of the last semester was to create a website with an illustrated, interactive cookbook. I based this project off a few central ideas: 
- Design an interactive website or app because of my computer science and design major
- Document family recipes for personal use
- Draw for fun

I was inspired by online games that required the user to click and interact with objects on the page and physical children’s books that had aspects like envelopes with letters inside or tabs to pull out. I also drew inspiration from lengthy Pinterest-esque recipe websites that included a lot of fluff to scroll past before getting to the actual recipe.

 
My final proposal at the end of my fall semester was an interactive library, with different cookbooks for different groupings of recipes. The user would select the cookbook they wanted to view, and there would be objects lying around the bookcase holding the books that they could interact with. 

*Insert semester 1 sketches*

In the spring I went on to research cookbooks and interactive children’s storybooks and ended up finding a section of “food as stories” that perfectly conveyed what I wanted—personal anecdotes in combination with recipes, instructions, and illustrations.
I noticed that some of the cookbooks didn’t follow strict sections of categorization. This led me to go with one cookbook rather than multiple and section them into “unconventional" sections that were more related to me personally and tailor them to be friendly to any age reading.
After this, I went on to list, categorize, and narrow down dishes to include, then collect the recipes from family members.

*Insert images of notes*

As I started designing the recipe book pages, I also illustrated different dishes that would accompany the recipes, as well as the background textures for the pages themselves.


## Final Product

I had many ideas for user interaction with the book that all became kind of overwhelming to consider, and a lot more work to finesse when I already had a lot going on. The software I was using, Adobe XD, was also limited in the complexity of interactions I could prototype, so I decided to limit everything to one type of interaction: toggling the appearance of post-it notes.
This went well with the "on the table" layout I used, since the few items scattered around the table also prompted simple interaction.

Though the final product was largely different from what I originally envisioned, the simplicity of it allowed more attention to be focused on the content.
I ended up including more illustrations than originally planned, thanks to the feedback of my peers.
