Hi, I’m Amanda _(she/her)_! I'm a proud Filipino American who grew up in the Hudson Valley, New York and spent five years studying computer science and interaction design at Northeastern University in Boston.

I've taken on the responsibilities of a front-end developer and UI/UX designer and I thrive in positions that incorporate skills from both of my disciplines. My favorite thing that design and code have in common is the creative process—I love seeing how the decisions made each step of the way come together to support the final product.

When it comes to my work, I enjoy improving any type of user experience, but I’m most passionate about sharing and preserving culture, uplifting marginalized voices, and building community, especially through storytelling.

I spend my time cooking and baking dishes from my favorite cuisines, ignoring my pile of unread books to buy new ones, singing both parts of the duet by myself, tinkering with my mechanical keyboard, making too many Spotify playlists, starting more video games than I tend to finish, and getting distracted by cute dogs in public.
