import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

I grew up in the Hudson Valley, New York, and spent the last five years going to Northeastern University in Boston studying computer science and interaction design.

I like to design compelling, accessible, and user-centered experiences through different mediums. Thanks to my combined degree, I've taken on the roles of a front-end developer and UI/UX designer, and love positions that incorporate skills from both of these disciplines.

Outside of work, I find some of my other passions lie in being engaged in Asian American communities, drawing and painting, trying to be a foodie, making too many Spotify playlists, and getting distracted by dogs in public.

I'm currently seeking job opportunities in New York City!
