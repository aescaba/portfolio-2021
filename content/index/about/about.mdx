import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

I'm Filipino American and use she/her pronouns. I grew up in the Hudson Valley, New York, and spent the last five years going to Northeastern University in Boston.

I've taken on the roles of a front-end developer, UI/UX designer, and graphic designer through Northeastern's co-op program, and I enjoy positions that incorporate skills from both of my disciplines.

I also love trying to cook/bake the dishes from my favorite restaurants, singing both parts of the duet by myself, making too many Spotify playlists, starting more video games than I tend to finish, and getting distracted by dogs in public.
