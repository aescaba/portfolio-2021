I like designing creative user-centered experiences. Whether it's <span class="emph">wireframing</span> an app, <span class="emph">coding</span> a website, or <span class="emph">sketching</span> the artwork, from the smallest quality-of-life details to the overall vibes, I love the process of creating!

I'm based out of the New York Metropolitan Area and am currently seeking front-end/UX developer opportunities.
