I like designing clean and inventive user-centered experiences. Whether it's <span class="emph">wireframing</span> an app, <span class="emph">coding</span> a website, or <span class="emph">sketching</span> the artwork, from the smallest quality-of-life details to the overall vibes, I love the process of creating!

I recently graduated from Northeastern University & I'm currently seeking job opportunities based in New York City.
