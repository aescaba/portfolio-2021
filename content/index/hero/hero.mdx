I like designing compelling and inventive user-centered experiences. Wireframing an app, coding a website, or making the artworkâ€”whether it's the smallest quality-of-life details or the overall vibes, I love getting involved in the process of creating.

I recently graduated from Northeastern University & I'm currently seeking job opportunities based in New York City!
